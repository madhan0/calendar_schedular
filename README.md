# CALENDAR-SCHEDULER
A calendar schedule is a tool used to organize and manage activities or events within a specific time period. It typically displays a calendar grid with dates, days of the week, and months, and allows you to schedule or mark important dates, appointments, meetings, or deadlines.

In addition to visualizing important events, a calendar schedule may also include details such as the start and end times of events, locations, and any notes or reminders related to the event.

Some calendar scheduling tools allow you to color-code or categorize events, making it easier to identify events at a glance. You may also be able to set up reminders or notifications for upcoming events, helping you stay on top of your schedule and avoid missing important appointments or deadlines.

Overall, a calendar schedule is a useful tool for individuals or teams who need to stay organized and manage their time effectively.
